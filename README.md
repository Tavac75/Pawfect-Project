Pawfect Harmony Adoptions is an integrated, user-friendly platform for pet owners 
and shelters to place pets for adoption. This peer-to-peer environment includes 
the ability to search a database and optimally match pets with loving homes.

Core Features:
* Owners can build a profile of the pet they want to put up for adoption.
* Visitors have the ability to search for adoptable pets in their area and request to meet or adopt a pet.
* A login/logout feature secures the site. 
* A user account page allows for easy profile updates and contains shortcuts to pets that they have put up for adoption/would like to meet. 
* A navigation bar allows for an intuitive user experience.
